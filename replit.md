# RDE v2.0 - Resident Development Environment

## Overview

RDE v2.0 is a comprehensive web-based development environment built with Node.js, React, and TypeScript. It provides a complete IDE experience with file management, code editing, terminal access, AI-powered chat assistance, and live preview capabilities. The application follows a full-stack architecture with a PostgreSQL database for persistence and real-time features via WebSockets.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS styling
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and local React state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor for syntax highlighting and IntelliSense

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket server for terminal and live updates
- **AI Integration**: Anthropic Claude API for chat assistance
- **Development Server**: Vite middleware integration for seamless development

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Files**: Project file storage with hierarchical structure
- **Chat Messages**: AI conversation history (temporary storage)

## Key Components

### RDE Core Interface
- **File Management System**: Virtual file system with database persistence, real-time synchronization, hierarchical structure
- **Code Editor**: Monaco Editor with syntax highlighting, multi-tab support, auto-save, language detection
- **Terminal Interface**: WebSocket-based terminal emulation, multi-session support, real-time command execution
- **AI Chat Assistant**: Claude-powered development assistance with context awareness and code generation
- **Live Preview**: Integrated preview window with automatic refresh and external browser support

### Agent Bridge Middleware (v2.0)
- **Intent Parser**: Extracts structured intents from AI chat outputs using pattern matching and NLP
- **Governance Validator**: Enforces rules from build protocol, validates intents against security policies
- **Execution Router**: Routes validated intents to appropriate handlers (file system, terminal, external APIs)
- **Audit Logger**: Comprehensive logging of all AI intents, validation results, and execution outcomes
- **Agent Bridge Core**: Central coordinator managing the AI → middleware → execution pipeline

### Security & Governance Framework
- **Build Protocol**: Configuration-driven governance rules with approval workflows
- **Intent Validation**: Multi-layer validation with rule-based filtering and modification
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking of all AI-generated actions with retention and analysis
- **Safety Mechanisms**: All middleware components disabled by default, require explicit activation

## Data Flow

### Current (Direct Execution)
1. **File Operations**: Client requests → Express API → Storage → File system sync
2. **Code Editing**: Monaco Editor → Auto-save → API → Storage → File system
3. **Terminal Commands**: WebSocket client → Terminal service → Shell execution → Real-time output
4. **AI Chat**: User input → Chat service → Anthropic API → Response streaming → UI update
5. **Live Preview**: File changes → Vite HMR → Preview window refresh

### Future (Agent Bridge Middleware)
1. **AI Intent Processing**: Chat input → Intent Parser → Governance Validator → Execution Router
2. **Validated Execution**: Intent → Security checks → Approved execution → Audit logging
3. **Approval Workflow**: Flagged intents → Pending approval queue → Manual review → Authorized execution
4. **Audit & Compliance**: All actions → Audit logger → Retention → Analysis & reporting
