üß† HETZNER DEPLOYMENT PALLET REQUEST

Please scaffold a production-grade Hetzner Deployment Pallet for RDE v2.0 with full AI-Governed Middleware architecture:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Structure (Monorepo Compliant)
- /pallet/
  - /frontend/ ‚Äî React + TypeScript + Vite frontend (RDE UI)
  - /backend/ ‚Äî Node.js + TypeScript backend services
    - /services/middleware/ ‚Äî Agent Bridge Middleware v2.0 (intent parsing, governance, routing)
    - /services/execution-engine/ ‚Äî Execution Engine v1.0 (event-driven file operations)
  - /system/
    - /build-protocol.json ‚Äî Build governance protocol file
    - /audit/ ‚Äî Audit logs directory (persistent logging)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Frontend Requirements:
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Monaco Editor
- File Explorer (live file tree)
- WebSocket Terminal Interface
- AI Chat Interface (Claude Agent)
- Project Preview Window
- Build Protocol editor interface

3Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Requirements:
- Node.js + TypeScript microservice architecture
- Middleware layer fully intercepting AI intents
- EventEmitter based routing between Middleware and Execution Engine
- Full audit logging with 30-day retention
- Approval Queue system scaffolded for manual reviews
- Governance rules fully enforced for semi-automatic mode

4Ô∏è‚É£ Dockerization:
- Full multi-stage Dockerfile for clean production builds
- Use absolute file paths for all serveStatic operations
- Ensure pre-compilation of TypeScript prior to container build (strict compile pattern)
- No devDependencies in production containers
- Persistent volume mapping for /system/audit logs

5Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variable Handling:
- .env file support for secrets and keys
- Fail-safe bootstrapping if required env vars are missing

6Ô∏è‚É£ Port Configuration:
- Default external port 5000 (compliant with existing Hetzner VPS standards)

7Ô∏è‚É£ Compliance with Palletizer Lessons:
- Full dist/ precompiled directory structure for production containers
- Avoid any dynamic path resolution inside Docker
- No relative imports that break Docker context boundaries
- Container entry point: `node dist/server/index.js` with clean dist separation

8Ô∏è‚É£ Self-Diagnostic Endpoints:
- /api/middleware/status
- /api/middleware/audit
- /api/middleware/approvals
- /api/middleware/config

9Ô∏è‚É£ RDE Naming Standardization:
- Internal project name: RDEv2_Hetzner_Pallet
- Artifact ID tagging for future Pallet Manager registry integration

Confirm once scaffold is complete. Do not execute builds yet ‚Äî prepare codebase structure first.
