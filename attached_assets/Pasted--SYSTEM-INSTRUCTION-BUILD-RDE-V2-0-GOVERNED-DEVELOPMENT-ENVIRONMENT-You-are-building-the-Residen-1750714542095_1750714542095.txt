üß† SYSTEM INSTRUCTION: BUILD RDE V2.0 GOVERNED DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

You are building the Resident Development Environment (RDE) version 2.0 with full foundational architecture. This is NOT a direct execution agent ‚Äî this is a scaffold for an AI-governed development environment.

‚úÖ Core Features Required:

1Ô∏è‚É£ File Explorer
- Real-time file tree
- Create / delete / rename files and folders
- Expandable, collapsible structure

2Ô∏è‚É£ File Editor
- Monaco editor interface
- Syntax highlighting for multiple languages
- Real-time file save and update tracking

3Ô∏è‚É£ Terminal
- Fully operational shell interface
- Real-time output streaming
- WebSocket-based backend execution

4Ô∏è‚É£ Chat Interface
- Claude-powered conversational interface
- Supports prompt-based code generation requests
- Integrated with the intent system, but DO NOT directly execute any system commands yet

5Ô∏è‚É£ Preview Window
- Live rendering of generated frontend applications
- Hot reloading for React/Vite apps
- Isolated from system failures

‚úÖ Architectural Rules:

- This scaffold should NOT execute code directly from AI. AI outputs are intents only.
- File writes, terminal commands, and deployments must eventually route through the middleware (to be scaffolded next).
- Build the full frontend interface but delay any middleware activation until after verification.
- Generate clean placeholder React/Vite fullstack template as default project.

‚úÖ Directory Structure:

- /frontend (RDE interface)
- /backend (API server for file system, terminal, chat backend, intent parsing)
- /middleware (leave empty for now, will scaffold middleware in next step)
- /projects (where AI-created apps will reside)

‚úÖ This is a clean foundation for full AI-governed architecture.

‚úÖ DO NOT reintroduce any chat persistence bugs from previous version. Keep chat fully stateless for now.

‚úÖ DO NOT hardwire system execution into chat outputs. Prepare for middleware insertion.

‚úÖ Once scaffold is complete, confirm:

- File Explorer is fully operational
- Terminal is fully operational
- Preview window works for default app
- Chat interface is live

‚úÖ Await further middleware scaffolding instructions once base scaffold verified.

This is Resident Development Environment v2.0 Bootstrap.
